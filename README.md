Inspiration:

Everyone loves wordle and many aggies play wordle daily! So whats the best way to incorprate wordle into more aggies daily life! Create an A&M themed Worlde!!

What it does:

Allows users to choose between four different categories of wordle, that are centerlized around A&M and the theme: wild west. Each category presents a different challenge. A&M unlimited prompt users to guess an A&M word with an number of letter. A&M wordle prompt users to guess an A&M word with 5 letters. Wild west prompt users to guess wild west themed word with 5 letters. Lastly, majors prompts users to guess acronyms of majors at A&M with 4 letters.

How we built it:

Starting with a home page html file with a css file and added html, javascript, and css files for each following page. On the home page, you can move to instructions or play. The instructions page included and html and css files. When play is pressed the categories html and css files included all the four wordle games. Each of the wordle games has html, css, as well as javascript files. To present the beginning song on the home page, we included a button that prompt a audio id that plays the song. When a game has won or lost in a category, a pop up image shows either reveille or a snake with music after clicked "ok" using audio id linking to the css file. The user can click the "go back" button to go back to previous screens to play again.

Challenges we ran into:

Understanding how to make the user interface work with html, css, and javascript, as well as implemting them together to make the visuals work. Figuring out how to commit and pull our code from github. When working on the wordle application, as user submitted a word, the colors of the letters didn't change to the appropriate grid box, letting user know which letters are correct, wrong, or correct letter in wrong place.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:

Creating a fully developed wordle game with multiple fun features and design applications, with very minimal experience in javascript, html, and css.

What we learned:

We learned how to use javascript, html, and css languges, as well as how to implement backend and frontend.
